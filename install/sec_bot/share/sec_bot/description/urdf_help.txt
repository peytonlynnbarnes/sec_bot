remember to run command "source install/setup.bash" if rviz2 is not running for some reason
to show robot/urdf in rviz "ros2 launch sec_bot rsp.launch.py" 
to launch rviz "rviz2"

- to use robot in gazebo "ros2 launch sec_bot rsp.launch.py use_sim_time:=true"
- to show robot in gazebo "ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -topic robot_description -entity bot_name"
- to launch gazebo "ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py"
^ these cmds are wrapped into "launch_sim.launch.py"
"ros2 launch sec_bot launch_sim.launch.py"

to spawn robot in gazebo " ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -topic robot_description -entity bot_sec "
if you add a new xacro file make sure to rebuild "colcon build --symlink-install"
to show joints "ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui"
